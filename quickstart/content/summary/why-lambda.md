description: Why should you use AWS Lambda
---

AWS Lambda is a fully managed compute service which allows you to focus on delivering value, and leaves all the
maintenance overhead to AWS.

What does fully managed mean in this case; A huge amount. Firstly the provisioning of servers, operating systems and 
runtimes. The scaling of capacity across multiple AWS availability zones. Load balancing of requests and automatic failover 
in case of failure. If you work in a regulated industry, AWS Lambda is [SOC](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/soc-faqs/), 
[HIPAA](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/), [PCI](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/pci-dss-level-1-faqs/), 
[ISO](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/iso-27001-faqs/) compliant.
